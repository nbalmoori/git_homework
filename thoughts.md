Initial takeaways for success:
1. Time management is going to be very important.
2. If I'm feeling stuck on a problem, I should google independently or collaborate with classmates on slack instead of spinning my wheels and getting frustrated.

Strategies I will try during Mod 0:
1. Work on my note-taking: color coding, leaving space for notes, creating a table of contents
2. Use calendaring to make sure I complete the Mod 1 pre-work on time.

I'd like to shout out my friend Stephanie for being a positive presence while I have been stressed out this week!
